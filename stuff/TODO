general:
	//try to use reference in request, not copying each str should make it faster, in addToBody and stuff
	//check std::string init to "", ft "", use std::string()
	format all nicely
	change variable names
	change srcs names and stuff
	check in every class if every variable & func is needed

response:
	most likely _body, _header, _filename, _is_binary are useless
	change const string in error codes
	check printDirectory & delete func
	./src/response/Response.cpp:186:	// TODO this most likely breaks if i send a .htmla file
	./src/response/Response.cpp:216:	// TODO theres a better way to change the set the length of response size

request:
	./src/request/Request.cpp:3:// TODO pretty sure theres variables that are not needed here!
	./src/request/Request.cpp:6:// TODO replace body len with body.size()?
	./src/request/Request.cpp:133:// TODO check each getter
	./src/request/Request.cpp:219:// TODO check if delete works
	// why ask for S_IWOTH (write perm on other users and not this user?)

cgi:
	./src/cgi/Cgi.cpp:31:// TODO erase _path_to_cgi DIS*
